# I'm a script freak

yeah, said it, I love automations and writing scripts, that's basically how I started to learn programming.
With this one, you can deploy a project and configure your WSL hosts to have it on a url. 
I've been using it lately to test a few ideas on dotnet/nextJS, it works pretty fine and its dockerized.
If you noticed problems, please let me know.
